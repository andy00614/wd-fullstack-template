## Common Mistakes to Watch

### Grammar Patterns
| Mistake | Correct | Times | Status |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| Missing verb "is/are" in clauses | "if X is available" not "if X available" | 1 | Learning |
| Comma before "if" | No comma: "test if" not "test, if" | 1 | Learning |

### Vocabulary to Upgrade
| B1 Word | C1 Alternative | Context |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| available or not | whether...is functioning | Testing something |
| want to | would like to, aim to | Expressing intent |

### Capitalization & Spelling
| Issue | Rule |
|-------|------|
| "i" → "I" | Always capitalize first-person pronoun |
| "english" → "English" | Languages are proper nouns |

## Session History

### 2026-01-12

**Message 1:**
> "I want to ask you help me fix this bug, it is very important for my project."

Issues: Missing "to" after "ask you", run-on sentence, "very important" → "crucial"

**Message 2:**
> "so, now, i want to test, if the english skill coach available or not"

Issues:
- Missing verb "is" → "if the skill **is** available"
- Capitalization: "i" → "I", "english" → "English"
- Comma overuse before "if"
- "available or not" → "whether...is working"

Better: "I'd like to verify whether the English coach skill is functioning properly."

**Message 3:**
> "Not enough, I need to note my english problem in a document, help me review and always imporve"

Issues:
- "english" → "English"
- "imporve" → "improve" (typo)
- "help me review" → "help me review them" or "to help me review"
- "always improve" → "continuously improve" (C1)
- Sentence structure: run-on sentence

Better: "That's not enough. I need to document my English mistakes so I can review and continuously improve."
